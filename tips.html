                <div class="tips-content-card">
                    <h2>Part 1: The Perfect Setup</h2>
                    <p>Ensure iDrive works seamlessly from day one by granting the necessary permissions for flawless background tracking.</p>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Enable "Always Allow" Location</h3>
                        <p>This is the most critical setting. It allows iDrive to run in the background and automatically detect when your vehicle starts and stops moving, ensuring <strong>no trip is ever missed</strong>.</p>
                        <p><em>Go to: <strong>Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > iDrive > "Always"</strong></em></p>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Allow Motion & Fitness Access</h3>
                        <p>This helps iDrive distinguish between different types of movement (like walking vs. driving), improving the accuracy of auto-detection and saving your phone's battery.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Turn On Background App Refresh</h3>
                        <p>Keeps the app ready to log trips instantly, even when you haven't used it recently.</p>
                        <p><em>Go to: <strong>Settings > General > Background App Refresh</strong> and ensure it's on for iDrive.</em></p>

                <div class="tips-content-card">
                    <h2>Part 2: The Effortless Weekly Habit</h2>
                    <p>Spend just 5 minutes a week to keep your logbook accurate and ready. Consistency is key to a stress-free tax claim.</p>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-robot"></i> Use Smart Trip Types</h3>
                        <p>Let iDrive do the heavy lifting. Set up <strong>automatic trip classification</strong> so weekday trips are pre-tagged as 'Business' and weekend trips as 'Personal'. This gives you a great head start.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i> The Weekly Dashboard Check</h3>
                        <p>Make it a Monday morning routine. Open the iDrive app and:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Check your dashboard's calculated <strong>Business Reimbursement Percentage</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Scroll through your trip list and look for any trips marked <strong>'Unreviewed'</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Tap each unreviewed trip and mark it as <strong>'Reviewed'</strong>. This action finalizes the trip's classification and locks it into your report calculations.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This simple habit ensures your reported percentage is always accurate and up-to-date.</p>

                    <h2>Part 3: Accuracy Pro-Tips</h2>
                    <p>Handle edge cases and verify your data to maintain a perfect logbook.</p>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> When to Manually Add a Trip</h3>
                        <p>Auto-tracking is incredibly reliable, but in rare cases like underground car parks or areas with very poor GPS signal, a trip might not log. If you notice a missing work journey, use the <strong>"+ Add Trip"</strong> feature to enter it manually. It takes seconds and keeps your record complete.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-clipboard-check"></i> Trust, But Verify: The Dashboard Review</h3>
                        <p>While iDrive automates everything, a quick sense-check is wise. When you review your weekly dashboard, ask yourself: <strong>"Does the Business Percentage feel right for my driving this week?"</strong></p>
                        <p>If something seems off, it's usually because a key trip is still 'Unreviewed'. Reviewing it will instantly update the calculation. This keeps you in control and confident in your data.</p>

                    <h2>Part 4: Tax Time Readiness</h2>
                    <p>Transform your tracked data into an ATO-ready, accountant-friendly logbook with minimal effort.</p>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> Don't Wait Until June</h3>
                        <p>Avoid the year-end scramble. Get into the habit of <strong>generating and exporting a report every quarter</strong>. This gives you a clear picture of your deductible kilometres year-round and makes tax time a simple matter of sending the final report.</p>
                    </div>

                            <li><strong>PDF Report:</strong> The clean, visual summary perfect for printing or sending directly to your accountant.</li>
                            <li><strong>CSV File:</strong> The raw data file. You can open this in spreadsheet software (like Excel or Numbers) for deeper analysis or custom reporting. This is best practice for maintaining your own master records.</li>

                        <p>The ATO requires you to keep logbook records for <strong>5 years</strong> after lodging your claim. The simplest way to comply? Create a dedicated folder (e.g., "Tax - Vehicle Logs") on your computer or cloud drive and save your quarterly PDF/CSV exports there. With iDrive, your compliance is fully digital and organized.</p>
